# COMP352_4
Dexter:

I commented as much as I can for all classes. It should be enough at the moment since I discussed briefly about the design choices. 
We might need to write out a Word Document just in case the comments are not enough. If you have time, you could do it but I will try to
finalize it in the morning.

TO-DO:
- Test cases
- File output
- PDF with the documentation
- R marker scheme (it works, but there are some strings that are missing, i'll try to fix it)
