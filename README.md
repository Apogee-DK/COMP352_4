# COMP352_4
Dexter:

I commented as much as I can for all classes. It should be enough at the moment since I discussed briefly about the design choices. 
We might need to write out a Word Document just in case the comments are not enough. If you have time, you could do it but I will try to
finalize it in the morning.

TO-DO:
- Test cases (5 more test cases? --> test remove for each option)
- File output
- PDF with the documentation



MADE THE R marker scheme WORK WOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
STRING IS FOUND AND REPLACED (i think)... i didn't have time to test it out because it's 3 am!
